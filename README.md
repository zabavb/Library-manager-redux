<h1 align="center">Library Manager</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>This React project was created to demonstrate the use of React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The project showcases the fundamental concepts of React, including components, state, and props, while integrating modern front-end practices.</p>

<h2>Development Details</h2>
<p>This project was developed as part of my learning journey with React on April 18, 2024, for hands-on practice with front-end web development. It was created exclusively by me as part of homework from the IT Step Academy.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Clone the repository:
    <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/zabavb/react-project.git</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>Install the required dependencies:
    <pre><code>npm install</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>Start the development server:
    <pre><code>npm start</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>Open <code>http://localhost:3000</code> in your browser to view the app.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Installing and Running Node.js <i>(If you don't have one)</i></h2>
<p>To run this Library Manager, Node.js needs to be installed on your machine. Follow these instructions to install and run Node.js:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Go to the <a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">official Node.js website</a> and download the latest stable version of Node.js.</li>
  <li>Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.</li>
  <li>After installation, verify it by opening a terminal and typing:
    <pre><code>node -v</code></pre>
    This should return the installed version of Node.js.</li>
  <li>Next, verify the npm installation by typing:
    <pre><code>npm -v</code></pre>
    This should return the version of npm.</li>
  <li>Once Node.js and npm are set up, run the following commands inside the project folder to start the React development server:
    <pre><code>npm install
npm start</code></pre>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Component-Based Structure:</strong> The app is structured around reusable React components.</li>
  <li><strong>State Management:</strong> Demonstrates basic state management using React's useState hook.</li>
  <li><strong>Props Usage:</strong> Components pass and receive data through props for flexible data handling.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>To use this app, clone the repository, install the dependencies, and run the development server as described above. You can modify components, add features, or use this as a base for further development.</p>

<h2>Contributing</h2>
<p>Contributions are welcome! If you have any suggestions or improvements, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.</p>

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
